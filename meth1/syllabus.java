# Course Description

Familiarizes teachers, grades with pedagogical approaches and
innovative teaching techniques needed to convey to a diverse
population emerging state and professional standards-based curriculum
in computer science. Innovative uses of technology, development of
instructional units, individualizing for a diverse population of
students, and strategies for managing problem behavior will be
emphasized throughout the course.

## Schedule
	- July 9 - July 30, Monday - Friday 12:30 - 3:00


## Grading

 - 30% : Demonstration of an understanding of CS teaching methods through class discussion, breakout rooms, small presentations.
 - 30% : Use of effective methods in delivery of Topics project
 - 20% : Final portfolio
 - 20% : participation


## By the end of this course, students will be able to:
   - develop coherent, meaningful goals, plans and materials.
   - Plan and deliver effective computer science instruction.
   - assess learning and differentiate instruction for diverse populations.
   - Employ a variety of effective pedagogical standards in order to deliver instruction aligned with the proposed CSTA standards.
   - Use current technology and CS content and will be able to learn new technologies and content. Teacher-candidates will be able to develop coherent, meaningful goals, plans, and materials.

1. Portfolio assignment due 1 week after last class session. 

   Students are to create a detailed lesson plan, outline and
   supporting materials for a computer science lesson. The lesson plan
   and outline should include a description of the intended student
   audience and a detailed explanation of how multiple pedagogical
   techniques can be used in delivering the lesson. 
   
   For example, if the lesson includes subgoal labeling, the project
   should include the finished desired code along with the subgoal
   labels included within.
   
   The plan must also be aligned to the New York State Standards for
   Digital Fluency and Computer Science.
   
   The completed assignment should be such that the portfolio can be
   given to any computer science teacher and they could deliver the
   lesson as intended.
