Create a lesson plan for a concept covered in the pre-work or the first programming course in this program (not data structures).
This should be a lesson plan for a High School class, ~45 miutes in length.
Assume the appropriate level of prior knowledge.
You need not create supplemental materials like sample code, assignments, etc.
You could use the template found here, but you do not need to, or you cna modify it.
Use whatever file format that is more convenient for you, but name the file 01_lesson and put it in your meth1 folder.

Topic: One-Dimensional Arrays

*/What this lesson is about:
This lesson explores arrays, which are used to store large amounts of information without needing to set up separate variables for each piece of information.
*/

Learning Objectives:
The students will:
1. Learn what an array data type is, and how to declare    and initialize an array
2. Learn how to extract and edit data which is
   contained in an array
3. Understand how array elements are indexed

Components:
1. Do Now - 5 minutes
2. Code Along Exercise - 10 minutes
3.Checking for Understanding - 5 minutes
4. Coding Activities (2) - 20 minutes
5. Exit Ticket: 5 minutes

/*What to Emphasize:
Arrays in Java store multiple elements of the same data type in a fixed order indexed starting from 0. The data type stored can be anything as long as it is the same for the whole array.
*/

/*Additional Comments:
While Arrays are stored as reference data and even inherit methods from java.lang.Object, there is no page for an array class in the API reference (the class Arrays just contains static methods for working on array objects). Technically for each possible data type stored in an array a new class is created. The few methods and variables for these classes can be found in chapter 10 of the java language specification.
