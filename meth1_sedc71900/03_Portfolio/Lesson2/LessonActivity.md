# Learning Target:
I can trace a pseudocode and correctly predict the final outcome. 
I can also read and use the the CB's reference sheet in class and during exams.

# Warm Up | Do Now
## Please read and be ready to ask or answer questions.
The multiple choice portion of the AP Exam will test your understanding of programming and algorithmic concepts using Pseudocode.

Pseudocode: an informal method of writing algorithmic instructions that does not necessarily follow grammatical rules and syntax of a particular programming language.

### Why do we use pseudocode?
1. To be concise: basic text language can get wordy.
2. To be precise: abbreviations run the risk of leaving out important info.

# Mini Activity - PseudoCode Trace #1:
Determine what is printed by the following code.

z ⬅ 1
l ⬅ 5
c ⬅ 2
l ⬅ l + 5
c ⬅ 1
l ⬅ z + 2
DISPLAY(z)
DISPLAY(l)
DISPLAY(c)

# Mini Activity - PseudoCode Trace #2:
Determine what is printed by the following code.

x ⬅ -7
REPEAT UNTIL (x > 3)
{
	x ⬅ x + 3
}
DISPLAY(x)

# Checking for Understanding:

## In Mini Activity #1:
Please explain or write as to why the final values of z, l and c are different from their initial values.

## In Mini Activity #2:
Replace initial x = -7 with x = 5.
Now code trace the final value of x.
Explain or write what you observed.

# Classwork: Think-Trace-Solve

## Groupwork: PseudoCode Trace Practice (#1):

Determine what is printed by the following code.

q ⬅ 1
x ⬅ 5
s ⬅ 4
x ⬅ q
s ⬅ x
q ⬅ x + 2
DISPLAY(q)
DISPLAY(x)
DISPLAY(s)

## Groupwork: PseudoCode Trace Practice (#2):

Determine what is printed by the following code.

x ⬅ -10
REPEAT UNTIL (x = 0)
{
	x ⬅ x + 5
}
DISPLAY(x)

# Exit Ticket/Summary (5 minutes):

Determine what is printed by the following code.
For an infinite loop, write infinite loop.

x ⬅ 15
REPEAT UNTIL (x = 11)
{
	x ⬅ x - 3
}
DISPLAY(x)

# Homework:
Please complete your homework as shown below.

Determine what is printed by the following code.

s ⬅ 3
y ⬅ 5
n ⬅ 4
y ⬅ s
s ⬅ 2
y ⬅ s + 4
DISPLAY(s)
DISPLAY(y)
DISPLAY(n)
