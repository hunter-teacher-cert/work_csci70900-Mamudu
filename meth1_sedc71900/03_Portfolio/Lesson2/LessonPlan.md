# Task: Unplugged activity

# Topic: Tracing Pseudocodes

This lesson introduces the concept of pseudocode, showing how it will be used to model programming logic in CS and on the AP CSP exam.

# Learning Objectives:
Students will be able to examine the use of pseudocode to quickly and clearly express general algorithmic ideas in CS.

Students will be able to familiarize themselves with the College Board's standardized pseudocode that will be used on assessments throughout the course and on the AP CSP Exam.

# What to Emphasize:
Students should begin to recognize and make connections to how flowcharts and programs could function in Pseudocode. As extra practice, encourage students to take an instruction set developed previously (such as in the Flowcharts activity or those in High- vs. Low-Level Languages) and try to write it in AP CSP pseudocode. Because pseudocode instructions aren’t programs, this will not always be an easy task.

# Common Misconceptions:
“I have to memorize the College Board’s pseudocode system.” Definitely not, that’s why you are allowed access to the reference sheet on the exam. Since there is no one “correct” way to write pseudocode, they wouldn’t make you memorize theirs.
