# Topic: Two Ways to End a while Loop
# Introduction
This lesson introduces two ways to end a while loop: 
using a count variable to run a loop a specific number of times, and using user input. 

# Learning Objectives:

Students will be able to end while loops using count variables and user input

Students will be able to state when to use them.

# What to Emphasize:
Just like when using strings in my control expression, or a user input variable, any variable, including the count variable must change inside the loop in order for the loop to eventually end.
A while loop can run an indefinite amount of times by gathering user input or it can run a set amount of times by controlling it with a count variable.
